# Network access vs. AWS API access

This demo shows the difference between accessing resources over the network (such as SSH on an EC2 instance) compared to accessing resource via an AWS API (such as Session Manager on an EC2 instance).

**Note:** RDS Data API for CloudFormation is not yet available, so the RDS part of the demo is not yet working.
