# Network access vs. AWS API access

This demo shows the difference between accessing resources over the network (such as SSH on an EC2 instance) compared to accessing resource via an AWS API (such as Session Manager on an EC2 instance).

Similarly you can connect to the RDS database over port 3306 (MySQL) to run queries, or you can use the RDS Data API to run the same queries.
